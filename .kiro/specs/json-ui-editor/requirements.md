# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a JSON-based declarative UI language that allows users to define HTML forms and UI components through JSON schemas, along with a visual editor for creating and managing these schemas. The system consists of two main components: a JSON schema specification for describing UI controls, validation, and layout, and an interactive editor that provides both visual and code-based editing capabilities with live preview functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a UI designer, I want to define UI forms using a structured JSON schema, so that I can create consistent, maintainable form definitions without writing HTML directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a JSON schema THEN the system SHALL support form metadata including title, description, and layout type
2. WHEN a user defines controls THEN the system SHALL support text, email, password, select, checkbox, and button control types
3. WHEN a user specifies validation rules THEN the system SHALL support required fields, min/max length, and pattern validation
4. WHEN a user defines select controls THEN the system SHALL support options with label and value pairs
5. IF a control is marked as required THEN the system SHALL enforce validation during form submission

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a renderer that converts JSON schemas to HTML, so that I can programmatically generate forms from the schema definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid JSON schema is provided THEN the renderer SHALL generate semantically correct HTML
2. WHEN validation rules are specified THEN the renderer SHALL apply appropriate HTML5 validation attributes
3. WHEN layout is specified THEN the renderer SHALL apply appropriate CSS classes or inline styles
4. IF the schema contains invalid structure THEN the renderer SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN controls are rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain proper accessibility attributes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a UI designer, I want a visual editor for creating JSON UI schemas, so that I can design forms without manually writing JSON.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts the editor THEN the system SHALL provide a blank form template
2. WHEN a user adds controls THEN the system SHALL provide a control palette with all supported types
3. WHEN a user selects a control THEN the system SHALL show a properties panel for configuration
4. WHEN a user modifies control properties THEN the system SHALL update the JSON schema in real-time
5. WHEN a user reorders controls THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a UI designer, I want to see a live preview of my form, so that I can visualize how the final HTML will appear while editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes changes in the editor THEN the preview SHALL update immediately
2. WHEN the JSON schema is valid THEN the preview SHALL show the rendered HTML form
3. WHEN the JSON schema has errors THEN the preview SHALL display error messages
4. WHEN a user interacts with preview controls THEN the system SHALL demonstrate validation behavior
5. IF the schema is empty THEN the preview SHALL show a placeholder message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to edit the raw JSON directly, so that I can make advanced modifications or import existing schemas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches to JSON mode THEN the system SHALL display syntax-highlighted JSON
2. WHEN a user edits the JSON THEN the visual editor SHALL update to reflect changes
3. WHEN invalid JSON is entered THEN the system SHALL highlight errors with helpful messages
4. WHEN valid JSON is pasted THEN the system SHALL parse and load it into the visual editor
5. IF JSON changes conflict with visual editor state THEN the system SHALL prioritize JSON as source of truth

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a UI designer, I want to save and load my form definitions, so that I can reuse and share my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves a schema THEN the system SHALL store it with a user-defined name
2. WHEN a user loads a schema THEN the system SHALL restore both visual editor and JSON states
3. WHEN a user exports a schema THEN the system SHALL provide a downloadable JSON file
4. WHEN a user imports a schema file THEN the system SHALL validate and load the contents
5. IF a schema name already exists THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before overwriting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a UI designer, I want validation and error checking, so that I can ensure my schemas are correct and complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates controls THEN the system SHALL validate that control names are unique
2. WHEN a user sets validation rules THEN the system SHALL check for logical consistency
3. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL highlight them with clear messages
4. WHEN the schema structure is invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent export until fixed
5. IF validation errors exist THEN the system SHALL display a summary of all issues

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a UI designer, I want to manage form layout and organization, so that I can create well-structured, visually appealing forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects layout type THEN the system SHALL support vertical, horizontal, and grid layouts
2. WHEN a user arranges controls THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for positioning
3. WHEN a user groups related controls THEN the system SHALL support section or fieldset organization
4. WHEN layout changes are made THEN the preview SHALL immediately reflect the new arrangement
5. IF controls don't fit the selected layout THEN the system SHALL provide responsive behavior guidance
